BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR Linux
==================================
You need to do two things to get started building an application using `cmake` on
Linux:
- Make certain you are in the `linux` folder.
- Run `cmake ..` to rebuild the buildsystem.
- Then run `cmake --build .` to build the application

* Pre-requisites
`cmake` is not installed by default in many distributions.   Use your
distribution's package manager to install it onto your system.

For example, for Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```
